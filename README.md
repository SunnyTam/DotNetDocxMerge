# DotNetDocxMerge
This is a gui project for merge data to  Microsoft Word document(.docx) from csv. I start this program because there is no solid program to solve mail merge in gui

## How to use
All you need is the  Microsoft Word document (.docx) which act as a template and an Excel (.csv) file which contains rows of data to bind to template.

The word document should contain "<<yourData>>" as a template marker. e.g. <<myName>> <<id-no>>

The first row of csv will count as header. Please make sure each header exist only once. 

## How to build
Build in Visual Studio.
